| **Timeline**          | Aug 2024 â€“ Dec 2024                                                                                                                                              |
| **Description**       | Interactive image-based guessing game where players identify an image shown initially zoomed-in. The image zooms out incrementally after wrong guesses.         |
| **Key Contributions** | - Created dynamic zoom effects and input validation using DOM manipulation  <br> - Designed engaging UX/UI to enhance gameplay experience  <br> - Strengthened frontend fundamentals including event handling and debugging |
| **Unique Qualities**  | Fun and educational project that deepened understanding of frontend development and user interaction design.                                                     |
| **Skills / Tools**    | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, UX/UI Design, Debugging                                                                                                 |
| **GitHub Link**       | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ArhaanM123/flocker_frontend)                                                                                              |
| **Struggle Faced**    | At the start, we struggled with creating a smooth zooming effect that felt natural and wasn't too jarring or abrupt for the player. Input validation was also tricky to implement without breaking the flow. |
| **How We Overcame It**| We overcame this by breaking down the zoom logic into incremental steps using CSS transitions and wrote clean JavaScript for real-time DOM manipulation. We tested extensively to handle edge cases in input validation. |
