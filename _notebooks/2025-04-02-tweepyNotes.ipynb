    "After experimenting Tweepy and spending time to get it to work, we discovered that the free plan only lets you pull a singular tweet every 15 minutes and 100 tweets a month, which had changed after Elon became CEO of twitter, being 500 tweets a month before. Due to this limitation we were unable to build an initial database using this API and I decided to scrap it. Now wer're looking into other options.\n",
