In Trimester 2 of this year, I worked on Neptune, an interactive website for students to use to aid them in studying and throughout school.

With the use of socket.io, I created an interactive chatroom where users could discuss homework, and their classes. Here is a video of a demonstration of the feature.

Overview
Neptune is a full-stack web app designed to help students manage their academic lives through centralized tools for schedules, events, and communication. As part of the platform, I built and integrated a real-time chatroom using Socket.io—enabling live, responsive conversations between users.

Reflection
"This project pushed me beyond my comfort zone—Socket.io was entirely new, and learning to build reliable real-time features was a steep, rewarding curve. It taught me how to think event-first, solve sync issues, and deliver responsive user experiences."
