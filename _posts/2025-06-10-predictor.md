# AP Exam Predictor 

## Overview
The AP Exam Predictor is a feature designed to estimate students' potential AP exam scores based on trends in their practice multiple choice and frq scores. Built as part of the Open Coding Society platform, the tool provides real-time feedback and personalized projections—helping students set realistic goals and prepare more effectively for their AP exams.

## How It Works

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1    | Input your quiz/test scores and confidence ratings |
| 2    |Calculate composite score, estimate your projected AP score |
| 3    | Results appear immediately on your profile dashboard |
| 4    | Revisit and refine inputs to track your preparation progress |

## My Unique Contributions
- Designed and implemented the AP predictor input interface with clear and responsive UX.
- Helped configure dynamic visual feedback for predicted scores (1–5 scale).
- Ensured predictions were stored and displayed consistently within the user’s profile view.
- Contributed to overall UI testing and user feedback collection during iteration.

## What I Learned
- How to integrate machine learning results into a frontend-driven user experience.
- UI strategies for presenting uncertain data (e.g., predictive scores) in a helpful, encouraging way.
- Best practices for connecting frontend forms with dynamic backend outputs.

## Timeline
- **Started:** March 2025  
- **Completed:** April 2025

## Reflection
This was my first time working with a live machine learning model in a real application. It was both challenging and exciting to bridge the gap between raw prediction logic and a student-friendly interface. The AP Exam Predictor taught me how impactful small UI decisions can be when delivering data-driven academic support tools.
