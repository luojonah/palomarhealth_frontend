I truly enjoyed our experience at Night at the Museum 2025 and valued the opportunity to receive real-time feedback from parents and adults. It was especially rewarding to demo my AP Exam Predictor feature and explain how it supports future students preparing for AP Computer Science Principles. Sharing our work and seeing how it could genuinely help others made me feel accomplished and proud of our teamâ€™s impact.
