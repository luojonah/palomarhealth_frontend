# Neptune | Real-Time Chatroom Feature

## Overview
Neptune is a full-stack web app designed to help students manage their academic lives through centralized tools for schedules, events, and communication. As part of the platform, I built and integrated a real-time chatroom using Socket.io—enabling live, responsive conversations between users.

## How It Works

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1    | Enter Neptune’s chatroom section |
| 2    | Send and receive messages live |
| 3    | Messages update in real-time |
| 4    | Switch between different threads |

## My Unique Contributions
- Designed and developed the chatroom’s frontend UI with real-time updates.
- Implemented Socket.io-based message broadcasting and client-server syncing.
- Enabled full CRUD operations for chat messages.
- Integrated WebSocket logic with Express.js and Flask-based backends.
- Debugged real-time errors and optimized sync consistency.

## What I Learned
- Hands-on experience with WebSockets and event-driven architectures.
- Overcame the challenge of learning Socket.io from scratch and integrating it with an unfamiliar stack.
- Strengthened full-stack communication design between frontend and backend.

## Timeline
- **Started:** March 2025  
- **Completed:** April 2025

## Reflection
This project pushed me beyond my comfort zone—Socket.io was entirely new, and learning to build reliable real-time features was a steep, rewarding curve. It taught me how to think event-first, solve sync issues, and deliver responsive user experiences.
