#  AP Grade Predictor: Using Machine Learning to Forecast Student Performance

**Project by**: [luojonah/palomarhealth_frontend](https://github.com/luojonah/palomarhealth_frontend)  
**Related Issues**: [#32 - Show Saved Grade After Login](https://github.com/luojonah/palomarhealth_frontend/issues/32), [#28 - Grade Saves to Profile](https://github.com/luojonah/palomarhealth_frontend/issues/28)

##  Overview

Our **AP Grade Predictor** is a machine learning-powered web feature designed to give students an estimate of their grade based on their self-assessment. This project is integrated into the Palomar Health Frontend and leverages a trained regression model to generate both a percentage score and a letter grade. The results are saved to the userâ€™s profile for easy retrieval.

---

##  The Machine Learning Model

We trained a **Linear Regression model** using a dataset of student characteristics and their actual grades. The dataset includes 11 input features, all scored from 1â€“5:

- Attendance  
- Work Habits  
- Behavior  
- Timeliness  
- Advocacy  
- Tech Growth  
- Tech Sense  
- Tech Talk  
- Communication and Collaboration  
- Leadership  
- Integrity

###  Binarizing Input

Before feeding data into the model, we simplify (binarize) the input:
- Ratings of 1â€“3 become `0`
- Ratings of 4â€“5 become `1`

This gives a rough estimate of student behavior and performance trends without relying on overly fine-grained data.

###  Output

The model predicts a **percentage score**, which is then converted into a **letter grade** using standard grading thresholds:


---

## ðŸ§  Backend API

We built a REST API using **Flask** to serve the model:

- POST `/api/grade/predict`
- GET `/api/grade/predict` *(JWT-protected)*

### POST `/predict`

- Accepts JSON with an `inputs` list of 11 values (each between 1 and 5)
- Returns predicted percent and letter grade

### GET `/predict` *(JWT Protected)*

- Returns the **saved grade prediction** from the user's profile

This ensures that users can retrieve their grade later without needing to re-enter their inputs.

---

##  Authentication

We protect the GET endpoint using JWT-based authentication. Only logged-in users can retrieve their saved predictions, which are stored in the database under their user profile.

---

##  Frontend Integration

We tackled a few issues to make the frontend fully functional:

###  [Issue #28](https://github.com/luojonah/palomarhealth_frontend/issues/28)  
We ensured that after a user submits their self-assessment, the **predicted grade is saved to their profile**.

###  [Issue #32](https://github.com/luojonah/palomarhealth_frontend/issues/32)  
We added logic so that when users **log back in**, their previously saved prediction is displayed.

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML / Bootstrap (Palomar Health UI)
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-RESTful, JWT Authorization
- **ML**: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- **Data**: Custom CSV dataset of self-reported academic habits and grades
