## 🧭 Final Reflection

Before I stepped into AP Computer Science Principles, I didn’t even know what computer science *was*. I assumed it was just typing code or fixing bugs, but this class completely changed my mindset.

From my first line of HTML to building full-stack apps and training ML models, CSP showed me the power of problem-solving through technology. I had never imagined that I could create real products that people use—or that I'd enjoy doing it so much. Through the process, I didn’t just learn how to code—I learned how to think like a developer.

Special thanks to **Mr. Mortensen**, who created an environment that was both challenging and inspiring. Your emphasis on creativity and real-world application made me believe in the impact a single student project can have. You made tech feel human and accessible.

And thank you to the amazing CSP class—I collaborated with peers, led teams, learned from others, and pushed myself to keep building. Every bug, every late-night brainstorm, and every presentation helped shape who I am today.

Now, I walk away with not just skills, but a vision: I want to build impactful tools that bring technology to people in powerful, meaningful ways—especially in finance, entrepreneurship, and community empowerment.  

Taking AP CSP was one of the most important decisions I’ve made in high school. It gave me direction, confidence, and an entirely new perspective on my future.

**Thank you all.**
