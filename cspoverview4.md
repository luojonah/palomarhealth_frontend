| **Description**       | Engineered a comprehensive academic toolset empowering students with data-driven insights to boost performance and manage study routines effectively. The platform includes three interconnected modules:<br>ðŸ§  **Exam Predictor**<br>ðŸ¤– **Grade Predictor**<br>ðŸ“… **Study Tracker** |
| **Key Contributions** | - Designed and implemented modular tools integrating statistics, ML, and visualizations<br>- Developed adaptable models across different academic systems<br>- Created clean UX and backend flows using Python, Flask, and Chart.js<br>- Enabled personalized learning support through data                  |
| **Unique Qualities**  | Reduces academic uncertainty by delivering personalized forecasts and habit tracking to empower smarter, motivated student learning throughout the year.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Skills / Tools**    | Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Flask, JavaScript, Chart.js, CSV File Handling                                                                                                                   |
